# ## some examples:

# Types are your basic building blocks.
# There are some builtins, or you can define your own.
# Here's a definition for a regular expression:
# type {{ name|upper }}_WHITESPACE = RE/[ \t]*/;

# A record is a collection of types.
# Here's one with the built-in types
# type example = record {

# };
