*NOTE*
==========

The only difference between this one and the one found on grigorescu's repository 
is this one creates .zeek file extensions instead of .bro, keeping up witht he latest 
changes the Zeek team has made to their tool

This binpac_quickstart can be used on the latest stable Zeek build for your plugins

Cheers!
