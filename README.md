**NOTE**
==========

The only difference between this one and the one found on grigorescu's repository 
is this one creates .zeek file extensions instead of .bro. I submitted the commits
but they haven't been accepted yet

This follows the update where Bro switched its naming convention to Zeek and will work
with the latest Zeek build.

Cheers!
